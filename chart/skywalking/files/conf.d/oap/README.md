If you don't want to use the default `application.yml` packed into the Docker image,
put your own `application.yml` under this directory to override the original one.

For now, we support the following files which will override the counterparts in the Docker image.

| File | Override |
| ---- | -------- |
| `application.yml` | The `application.yml` in the OAP Docker image |
